- There is a third category next to statically typed and dynamically typed: unityped. In that paradigm, all variables have a single type, usually a machine register integer. Unityped languages aren’t common today, but some Forths and BCPL, the language that inspired C, worked like this.

- If you’re familiar with a language in the ML family, structs and unions in C roughly mirror the difference between product and sum types, between tuples and algebraic data types.

- You can pass macros to macros as parameters

- Is a <= b always the same as !(a > b)? According to IEEE 754, all comparison operators return false when an operand is NaN. That means NaN <= 1 is false and NaN > 1 is also false.
