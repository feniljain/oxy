- The rule uses * to allow matching a series of calls like fn(1)(2)(3). Code like that isn’t common in C-style languages, but it is in the family of languages derived from ML. There, the normal way of defining a function that takes multiple arguments is as a series of nested functions. Each function takes one argument and returns a new function. That function consumes the next argument, returns yet another function, and so on. Eventually, once all of the arguments are consumed, the last function completes the operation.

This style, called currying, after Haskell Curry (the same guy whose first name graces that other well-known functional language), is baked directly into the language syntax so it’s not as weird looking as it would be here.
