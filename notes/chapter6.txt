- Error parsing rules are super useful, you make error grammar rules which help parser not panic, but instead when they are encountered just insert the error in a list, and move on, this also helps parser keep moving.

- Also as we know more about the error due to the specific error rule, we can give better fixing reports. But what I think is how many such rules can you include, there can be so many cases where parsing may be go wrong due to wrong syntax, they would have to be limited and hence not depending on them completely would be a good idea.
