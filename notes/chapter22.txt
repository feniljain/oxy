- I designed Lox to be amenable to single-pass compilation to stack-based bytecode. But I didn’t have to tweak the language too much to fit in those restrictions. Most of its design should feel pretty natural.

This is in large part because the history of languages is deeply tied to single-pass compilation and—to a lesser degree—stack-based architectures. Lox’s block scoping follows a tradition stretching back to BCPL. As programmers, our intuition of what’s “normal” in a language is informed even today by the hardware limitations of yesteryear.
