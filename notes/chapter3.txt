# Challenges

## Challenge1:

Question: The lexical grammars of Python and Haskell are not regular. What does that mean, and why aren’t they?

## Challenge2:

Question: Aside from separating tokens—distinguishing print foo from printfoo—spaces aren’t used for much in most languages. However, in a couple of dark corners, a space does affect how code is parsed in CoffeeScript, Ruby, and the C preprocessor. Where and what effect does it have in each of those languages?

## Challenge3:

Question: Our scanner here, like most, discards comments and whitespace since those aren’t needed by the parser. Why might you want to write a scanner that does not discard those? What would it be useful for?

Answer: Documentation

## Challenge3:

Answer: Check implementation
